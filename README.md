# Convolutional Neural Network

Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network for the classification of tomato leaves diseases', having in total 11 classes and data for each class. There's data for training and validation for each one of the classes listed in the dataset.

# SMA0401C
## Uses a framework to implement a Deep Learning Model
The Convolutional Neural Network is implemented as a Deep Learning Model, using TensorFlow and the Keras API.
## Evaluate the model with its initial configuration and make adjustments to improve its performance
The model is evaluated with a test and validation set, with an initial configuration and an improved version. Since the first model had overfitting, regularization techniques (dropout) was implemented.
## Uses a real dataset and not one used for the class for the model development
The Tomato Leaf Disease dataset from Kaggle has real images used for the classification of diseases that can be found in tomato leaves.
